# Hacker UI Needs You

Hacker UI needs your feedback and support. <Emoji><span role="img" aria-label="Heart">❤️</span></Emoji>

This project is 100% independent of any company and is 100% open source.

Hacker UI is in an early alpha state. There's still a lot to do, optimize, and think about! Take a look at the [roadmap](https://github.com/ricokahler/hacker-ui/issues/6) and see the [help wanted](https://github.com/ricokahler/hacker-ui/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) issues.
