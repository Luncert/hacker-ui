# Hacker UI

Hacker UI is a **lean** and **themable** library of primitive React components.

It focuses on creating a very thin layer over standard HTML elements to keep the library fast, stable, and easy to use.

## <Emoji><span role="img" aria-label="">👩‍🎨</span></Emoji> Design Philosophy

Hacker UI was created out of the need for a vanilla component library that represents the modern web.

Of course there are many other great component libraries out there but in my opinion, they can be [too Googly](https://material-ui.com/), [too](https://blueprintjs.com/) [corporate](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/get-started/web), [too mid-2000s](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), or [just too bloated](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=antd).

Instead of trying to be a distinct brand or do too much, **Hacker UI simply tries to blend in and look good.** By default, Hacker UI aims to look like your standard modern web application.

However, don‘t forget that Hacker UI is **themable** making it a great **design system foundation**. You can choose to theme it to fit your brand or you can choose to leave it as is.

## <Emoji><span role="img" aria-label="">🎯</span></Emoji> Focused on the Job

Hacker UI’s core philosophy is built on **simplicity**.

Simplicity keeps this library focused on doing what it does best. Hacker UI is just a library of atomic components. Instead of creating deep abstractions, Hacker UI **embraces composable, modern HTML and CSS** and moves on.

You'll find Hacker UI to be somewhat low-level, but this is on purpose. It's hard to predict how you’ll use these components or even how the web will evolve so we don’t.

We have one job and we do it well.

Since Hacker UI is just a thin layer over HTML, if you know HTML and React, you know Hacker UI. This library is easy to use because it does what you expect.

Hacker UI small, easy to learn, and just what you need in order to bring your idea to life <Emoji><span role="img" aria-label="Heart">❤️</span></Emoji>.
